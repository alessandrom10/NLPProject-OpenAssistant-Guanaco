	Briefly describe the dataset:
		- what type of documents does it contain?
		- how many documents are there?
		- calculate and visualise some simple statistics for the collection, e.g. the average document length,
		the average vocabulary size, etc.
		
	Play around with documents, using some of the code from the early parts of the course. You could, for
	example:
		- cluster the documents and visualise the clusters to see what types of groups are present (or
		whether the known classes can be found); (Alessandro)
		- index the documents so that you can perform keyword search over them; (Filip)
		- train a Word2Vec embedding on the data and investigate the properties of the resulting
		embedding. (Alessandro)
